## libParanumal
An experimental set of finite element flow solvers for heterogeneous (GPU/CPU) systems. The initial development of libParanumal was performed by the [Parallel Numerical Algorithms Group at Virginia Tech](http://paranumal.com).   

libParanumal is funded in part by the US Department of Energy as part of the activities of the [Center for Efficient Exscale Discretizations](http://ceed.exascaleproject.org). 

Why is it called libParanumal ?: the high-order finite-element implementations in libParanumal are __spectrally__ accurate and rely heavily on __ghost__ elements for MPI communications.

If you use libParanumal as part of a research project see Section 8 below for papers to reference.

### 1. Overview 

Brief summary of major features:

A. Supported elements:
  - Triangles, quadrilaterals, tetrahedra, hexahedra.
  - Lagrange basis functions.
  
B. Mesh wrangling:
  - Gmsh format file loaders.
  - Load balanced geometric partitioning using space filling curves (Hilbert or Morton ordering). 
  
C. Time integrators:
  - Adaptive rate Dormand-Prince order 5 Runge-Kutta.
  - Low storage order 4 Runge-Kutta.
  - Single and Multirate Adams-Bashforth order 3.
  - Extrapolated Backwards Differencing order 3.
  
D. Iterative linear solvers:
  - Preconditioned (flexible) Conjugate Gradient method.
  - Non-blocking Preconditioned (flexible) Conjugate Gradient method.
  
E. Elliptic solver:
  - Linear Poisson and screened Poisson potential solvers.
  - GPU optimized matrix-vector products.
  - p-type multigrid, algebraic multigrid, low-order SEMFEM, and Jacobi preconditioning.
  - Matrix-free p-multigrid for fine levels of multigrid hierarchy.

F. Heterogeneous accelerated flow solvers:
  - Compressible Navier-Stokes solver with:
     * Upwind discontinuous Galerkin discretization in space.
     * Optional isothermal equation of state.
  - Galerkin-Boltzmann gas dynamics solver with:
     * Penalty flux DG discretization in space.
     * Adaptive semi-analytic (pointwise exponential) integration in time.
     * Multiaxial quasi-perfectly matched absorbing layer far field boundary condition.
  - Incompressible Navier-Stokes solver with:
     * Choice of continuous FEM or interior penalty DG in space.
     * Extrapolation-BDF integration in time.
     * Sub-cycling (Operator Integration Factor Splitting) for advection.

G. Dependencies:
   - Message Passing Interface (MPI v3.0 or higher).
      * The libParanumal makefiles assume that mpic++ is installed and visible in your path.     
   - Open Concurrent Compute Abstraction (OCCA) 
      * OCCA must be installed.
      * OCCA will try to detect if any of these execution models are installed: OpenMP, CUDA, OpenCL, and/or HIP.
      * By default, if OCCA does not detect a chosen mode of execution it will default to Serial execution.
      * You will need to adjust the libParnumal setup input files to choose the execution model and compute device appropriate for your system.
      * The OCCA github repo is [here](https://github.com/libocca/occa)
      * The OCCA webpage is [here](http://libocca.org)

### 3. OCCA dependency
`git clone https://github.com/libocca/occa`

#### 3-1. Build OCCA 
`cd occa`    
`export OCCA_DIR=${PWD}`  
`export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$OCCA_DIR/lib`    
```make -j `nproc` ```    
`cd ../  `  

---
### 4. Clone: libParanumal
`git clone https://github.com/paranumal/libparanumal`

#### 4-1. Build all libParanumal solvers
`cd libparanumal`    
```make -j `nproc` ```

---
### 5. Running the codes: 

Each solver resides in its respective sub-directory in `solvers/`. Each solver sub-directory includes makefile, src directory, data directory (including header files for defining boundary conditions), okl kernel directory, and setups directory. The setups directory includes a number of example input files that specify input parameters for the solver.

#### 5-1. Build libParanumal elliptic solver
  
`cd libparanumal/solvers/elliptic`    
`make -j  `  

#### 5-2. Run elliptic example with provided quadrilateral set up file on a single device:
  
`./ellipticMain setups/setupQuad2D.rc`  

#### 5-3. Run the same example with two devices:

`mpiexec -n 2 ./ellipticMain setups/setupQuad2D.rc`
